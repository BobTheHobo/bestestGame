# Gameplay:
- Player sits at table to play the card game against other members of the crew
- Player can stand up once unchained to walk around the room and complete puzzles.
- Players can hold items that are used to interact with objects around the room.
- The card game is relatively simple with 3 lanes where you can put cards represented as 3 galleys in a naval battle.  Cards increase the power of their represented galley and when players stop playing cards, any galley with less power than its opposite is removed until one side loses all galleys.
- Specific cards have various effects such as strengthening other cards, drawing cards, weakening enemy cards, etc.  The player gets choices on adding cards to their deck as the game progresses.
- There is possibly a third deck in addition to yours and the opponents that can cause events that change the board state themed after maritime events (tides, winds, etc.).  These can be represented by changing the appearance of the play mat on the table.
- Some items that the player collects can be placed at the table and used during the game to give advantages.  Such as a bottle of rum causing you to “see double” and double the power of your next played card.
- After you defeat a member of the crew and do a puzzle, another member will enter until you are able to play the captain and escape the hold.
- After you escape the hold, you walk on deck, alone, staring into the vast emptiness of the ocean for eternity (very artful).
